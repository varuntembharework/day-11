# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Day 11 â€“ Skeleton)

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
The **Library Management System (LMS)** is a **C++ console-based project** designed to manage library operations like book management, user management, and transactions (issue/return).

This project will be developed step by step over **Day 11 â†’ Day 15**, where each day we add new features to make it **100% functional and portfolio-ready**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Day 11 Goals
- âœ… Build the **project skeleton** (blueprint)  
- âœ… Create a **menu-driven structure** (Admin + User menus)  
- âœ… Define **data structures** (`Book`, `User`, `Transaction`)  
- âœ… Implement **placeholder functions** for all core features  

At this stage, the system runs with menus but shows `"Feature coming soon..."` messages.
